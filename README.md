# HydrTDependenceAmFibrils
Data and scripts to generate the figures in the manuscript on the hydrophobic
temperature dependence of amyloid fibril formation.

The figures showing the analysis results of the simulations were generated
with R scripts. If you run them, make sure to modify the directory names in
'setDataSources.R'. Also modify the location of the data files ('dataframesEnthaly_....Rdata')
in each of the scripts.

Figure 2a: HeatMap_SA.R
Figure 2b+2c+S2: ManuscriptFiguresSA_ac_b.R
Figure S1: PaggrFiguresSA.R
Figure S3 + S4: SuppFiguresSA.R

The figures showing the analysis results of the experiments were generated
with Python2.7 scripts.
